Communicate effectively the results of relevant research to peers, learners and the community in terms that can be easily understood 

#### AS.S.5

Undertake a literature search of relevant medical information sources, including online databases, Cochrane Collaboration articles and journal publications relevant to rural and remote medicine

#### AS.S.6

Communicate effectively the results of relevant research to peers and colleagues for example within the context of a journal club or clinical meeting 

#### AS.S.7

Use self-reflection and personal practice audit, to document and evaluate the efficacy of changes made in your own clinical teaching performance and patient care

#### AS.S.8

Perform and present clinical audit through: case finding, collecting data in an ethical manner, statistical analysis of data, identifying and implementing change, and monitoring progress 

#### AS.S.9

Manage patient privacy issues relating to clinical audit data storage and communication

#### AS.S.10

Participate in and use the results of case presentations in which the learner has a clinical role, as a basis for identifying steps leading to improvements in their clinical performance

#### AS.S.11

Use questioning and role modelling to challenge learners to develop the predisposition and skill of self-assessing their own performance as a basis for defining their learning needs, and for identifying opportunities inherent in everyday clinical practice 

#### AS.S.12

Analyse learner’s errors (near misses or adverse events) using root cause analyses, and ensure learning from an event through discussion in a non-punitive environment

#### AS.S.13

Set aside time to incorporate learning into worktime, and identifying key professional groups, conferences and professional journals you will subscribe to

#### AS.S.14

Define the outcomes (knowledge, skills and attitudes) that would be expected of a learner at the end of an education session, outcomes that consider the current knowledge level of the learner, their curriculum needs, their motivation, and capacity to learn, and their social and cultural background

#### AS.S.15

Use a structured approach to teach a skill or procedure to a medical student, which includes explanation, then demonstration, then observation of performance and feedback
