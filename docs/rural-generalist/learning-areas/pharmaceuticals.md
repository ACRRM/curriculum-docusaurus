### 💡 Knowledge

#### CG.K.1

Describe pharmacology basic science, including:
- mechanism of drugs at the receptor and intracellular level 
- principles of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of drugs
- effect of ageing, pregnancy and lactation on pharmacokinetics
- importance of genetic alterations in drug metabolism
- effect of climate and storage conditions
- pharmacological basis of drug interactions, and
- impact of organ dysfunction on pharmacokinetics and dose modification

#### CG.K.2

Explain the principles of prescribing pharmaceuticals:
- patient factors impacting on prescribing – allergy, age, pregnancy, over the counter (OTC) medications and nutraceuticals (eg fish oil, turmeric, glucosamine, vitamins etc) 
- appropriate dose adjustments in disease, ageing, pregnancy and other medications
- categories of drug safety in pregnancy and impact on prescribing
- principles of dose titration, and
- legislation regarding prescribing and controlled and restricted drugs

#### CG.K.3

Identify adverse reactions and interactions:
- common and life-threatening drug interactions and common presentations of drug-induced disease, adverse drug reactions, and
- common interactions between prescription and non-prescription and complementary therapies

#### CG.K.4

Discuss the quality use of medicines:
- factors affecting adherence
- factors increasing risk of medication error
- techniques for enhancing medication safety
- factors predisposing to polypharmacy (therapeutic cascade) and reasons for over prescribing, and
- delivery techniques for specific medicines
- delivery devices e.g. pumps, syringe drivers
- remember the recommendation to prescribe generically where possible
- consider working with pharmacist eg Webster packing, medication reviews, and medication use or prescribing clinical audits re quality outcomes

#### CG.K.5

Discuss the range of treatment modalities patients may seek including complementary therapies
