## Core Generalised

### 💡 Knowledge


#### CG.K.1

Describe the normal anatomy, physiology and ocular function of the eye

#### CG.K.2

Identify presenting signs, symptoms and management of common eye presentations 

#### CG.K.3

Distinguish between the conditions of the eye and describe the treatment and referral criteria 

#### CG.K.4

Identify the role of other health care professionals, including ophthalmologists, optometrists in diagnosing and treating conditions of the eye
Skills 

#### CG.S.1

Test and evaluate visual function, including: 
- visual acuity 
- colour vision 
- visual fields 
- ocular motility

#### CG.S.2

Diagnose and interpret abnormalities of the optic nerve and fundus 

#### CG.S.3

Independently perform the following assessments:
- Test and evaluate visual function including eye movements and position, visual acuity, visual fields, colour vision, ocular motility and pupillary function
- Test and evaluate abnormal eye movements and positions 
- Perform an examination of the external eye including the conjunctivae, sclera, cornea and eyelids and be able to evert the upper lid 
- Perform examinations using an ophthalmoscope, including fundoscopy 
- Measure intraocular pressure using applanation tonometry techniques and be familiar with other techniques for measuring intraocular pressure
- Assess for strabismus including the cover test and differentiate from pseudostrabismus
- Perform slit lamp examinations to diagnose and remove corneal foreign bodies diagnose iritis, assess corneal ulcers and assess eye trauma 

#### CG.S.4

Undertake initial assessment and triage patients with injuries to the eye

#### CG.S.5

Recognise causes of preventable blindness and minimise deterioration of function through appropriate initial treatment and referral

#### CG.S.6

Undertake initial assessment and triage patients with acute loss of vision

#### CG.S.7

Independently perform the following procedures:
- instil eye drops and ointment 
- tape lids to prevent corneal and conjunctival exposure
- fluorescein staining of the cornea and sclera 
- dilatation of the pupils
- pressure patch an eye
- eyelid eversion 
- irrigate an eye 
- remove contact lenses 
- shield eye 
- removal of corneal foreign bodies 
- removal of subtarsal foreign bodies

#### CG.S.8

Prescribe topical and systemic medications for eye, including:
- antibiotics, antivirals 
- topical steroids 
- anti-glaucoma 
- mydriatics and cycloplegics 
- diagnostic agents 
- local anaesthetics
