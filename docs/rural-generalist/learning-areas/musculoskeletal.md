## Core Generalist

### Knowledge

#### CG.K.1

Describe basic anatomy, physiology and biomechanics relevant to musculoskeletal disorders including: 

* normal functioning of the axial and appendicular skeleton and musculature 
* pathways of innervation of muscles 
* dermatome innervation and trigger point distribution 
* functional anatomy of joints surface anatomy

#### CG.K.2

Illustrate the mechanisms, characteristics and patterns of pain, including: 

* somatic 
* referred somatic 
* radicular 
* referred visceral 
* referred trigger point pain
  Skills 

#### CG.S.1

Take an accurate and relevant musculoskeletal history including:  

* a general history
* history of the presenting complaint including: 
  	mode and context of onset 
  	detailed characteristics of the pain\
  	effects on the patient's life and work 

#### CG.S.2

Perform an appropriate musculoskeletal examination, including:

* Look: inspection including surface appearance, symmetry, alignment and gait 
* Feel: palpation of surface temperature, bones, muscles, tendons, joint lines
* Move: active, passive, resisted, relative smoothness and end point quality
* Test function: appropriate provocation tests (special tests)
* Measure: length or circumference
* Look elsewhere: compare to the other side for all aspects above, assess neurovascular if appropriate
* Image: interpret along with clinical finings

#### CG.S.3

Conduct a musculoskeletal examination of the all parts of the body with functional testing that includes:

* Cervical spine glide and foraminal compression test, brachial plexus tension
* Shoulder apprehension and specific impingement tests
* Wrist: Tinel’s and Phalen’s sign 
* Spine: Waddell’s test when appropriate 
* Hip: Trendelenburg’s sign and special tests for the hip in children: Barlow’s, Ortolani’s tests
* Knee tests: Lachman’s, McMurray’s, Apley’s, and pivot shift tests as appropriate to assess functionality
* Active, passive and resisted movements in examination, including neurological testing by resisted movement

#### CG.S.4

Order and interpret appropriate imaging, including X-ray, CT, bone scan, ultrasound scan and MRI

#### CG.S.5

Use algorithms for the differentiation of visceral and somatic pain in the thorax and pain referred to the abdomen, especially for red flag conditions, such as;

* cardiac ischaemia
* aortic dissection 
* pneumothorax
* pulmonary neoplasm 
* spinal infections 
* neoplasia 
* painful conditions such as: herpes zoster, oesophagitis, peptic ulcer, cholelithiasis and psychogenic pain

#### CG.S.6

Apply diagnostic reasoning to arrive at one or more provisional diagnoses, considering conditions affecting the musculoskeletal system, including:

#### CG.S.7

Management common musculoskeletal presentations in community, primary care, including:

* osteoarthritis, 
* pain back, shoulder, knee, foot, toe
* neck symptoms 
* muscle symptoms, not otherwise specified (NOS)

#### CG.S.8

Perform the following procedures:

* soft tissue injection
* corticosteroid injections of joints, ganglions and around tendons
* aspirate of bursae and joints
* soft tissue injury strapping
* apply fibreglass and plaster casts and immobilisation of other fractures
* stabilisation of injured spine
* unlock a locked temporomandibular joint and knee
* reduce joint dislocations 
* reduce simple fractures

#### CG.S.9

Use a comprehensive evidence-based approach to recovery including:

* specific therapy 
* psychological support 
* self-directed activities 
* therapist conducted therapies
* motivation 
* a supportive environment and 
* general health initiatives

#### CG.S.10

Teach exercises and stretches relevant to all common musculoskeletal conditions, including techniques for self-correction of posture, use of appropriate lumbar support and improving posture whilst lying down

#### CG.S.11

Refer, facilitate and coordinate access to specialised support services as required to assist patients to return to functional work and/or life 

#### CG.S.12

Recognise and manage abuse in its various forms including those at risk or in a situation of abuse, violence, neglect, homelessness or accidental injury
