## Introduction

Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), the home of the Rural Generalist. 
ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice. \

ACRRM’s standards and training program prepares medical practitioners to practise safely and confidently as rural generalists.  Attainment of Fellowship (FACRRM) leads to specialist registration as a general practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia.\

## The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine

The Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM) was formed in 1997 as an
acknowledgment of: 

* the importance of rural and remote medicine as a broad and distinctive form of general
  practice
* the need for well-designed vocational preparation and continuing medical education for
  rural doctors, and
* the need to address the shortage of rural and remote doctors in Australia, by providing
  them with a separate and distinctive professional body

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define
standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice.

At the time of writing this document, an application to have Rural Generalist medicine
recognised as a protected title and as a specialised field within the speciality of general practice
is being progressed.

## What is a General Practitioner?

The General Practitioner is the doctor with core responsibility for providing comprehensive and
continuing medical care to individuals, families and the broader community. Competent to
provide the greater part of medical care, the General Practitioner can deliver services in the
primary care setting, the secondary care setting, the home, long-term residential care facilities
or by electronic means – wherever and however services are needed by the patient within their
safe scope of practice.

Fellows of ACRRM receive specialist registration as a General Practitioner with the Medical
Board of Australia and can practise in any location throughout Australia.

ACRRM’s curriculum and training program also prepares doctors to be Rural Generalist medical
practitioners. test

  local and distant, to provide services within a ‘system of care’ that is aligned and
  responsive to community needs. (World Summit on Rural Generalist Medicine, Cairns, 2014).
