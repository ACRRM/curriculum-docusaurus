## Introduction

Welcome to the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine (ACRRM), the home of the Rural Generalist. 

ACRRM is a professional college accredited by the Australian Medical Council to define standards and deliver training in the medical specialty of general practice. 

ACRRM’s standards and training program prepares medical practitioners to practise safely and confidently as rural generalists.  Attainment of Fellowship (FACRRM) leads to specialist registration as a general practitioner with the Medical Board of Australia.

Being a rural generalist means you have specific expertise in providing medical care for rural and remote or isolated communities. As a rural generalist you understand and respond to the diverse needs of rural communities including; applying a population health approach, providing safe primary, secondary and emergency care, culturally safe Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people’s health care and providing specialised medical care in one or more of the Advanced Specialised Training disciplines offered by ACRRM. 

This handbook has been designed to support ACRRM’s training program policies and provide you with comprehensive information to enable you to plan and tailor your training and education needs to attain Fellowship.

## Curriculum

The [Rural Generalist Curriculum](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/training/curriculum) provides a definition of Rural Generalist Medicine and describes the competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes required to be a rural generalist medical practitioner. 

The curriculum informs the training, education and assessment requirements to achieve Fellowship. Therefore, an understanding of the curriculum is essential for all registrars.

The Curriculum competencies are structured under the eight domains of rural and remote practice. 

1. Provide expert medical care in all rural contexts
2. Provide primary care
3. Provide secondary medical care
4. Respond to medical emergencies
5. Apply a population health approach
6. Work with Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, and other culturally diverse communities to improve health and wellbeing 
7. Practise medicine within an ethical, intellectual and professional framework
8. Provide safe medical care while working in geographic and professional isolation

The curriculum consists of Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components. Registrars must demonstrate meeting all competencies at the Core Generalist standard and choose one specialised area in which they demonstrate meeting the competencies at the Advanced Specialised standard. 

These standards are described in the curriculum. The Curriculum also details the knowledge, skills and attributes in 37 clinical and non-clinical Learning Areas. The Learning Areas all include Core Generalised content and Advanced Specialised content is included for the approved AST disciplines. 

## Fellowship Training Program

## Components of training

The training program is aligned to the eight domains of Rural Generalist Curriculum and underpins the learning areas included in the Core Generalist and Advanced Specialised components of the Curriculum.

### Core Generalist Training

Core Generalist Training (CGT) covers three years of training

* developing broad generalist knowledge, skills and attributes in primary, secondary and emergency care in a rural and remote context, and 
* fostering essential rural generalist knowledge and skills in paediatrics, obstetrics and anaesthetics.

### Advanced Specialised Training

Advanced Specialised Training (AST) covers one year of training

* building on the core generalist competencies and increasing knowledge and skills in a procedural or non-procedural discipline 
* in a specialised area relevant to the needs of rural communities
* to allow autonomous delivery in a defined scope of specialist clinical practice.

## Training program summary

### Commencement of training

Registrars who hold general registration and are in post graduate year (PGY) 2 must commence with CGT and undertake the first 12 months full time equivalent (FTE) in a Postgraduate Medical Council (PMC) accredited post. Those who are PGY 3 or above may undertake the first 12 months FTE in a PMC accredited post.

Registrars who hold general registration and are PGY3 or above may commence training with CGT or AST in an ACRRM accredited primary or secondary care training post as applicable.

Registrars who hold limited or provisional registration require an individual training plan approved by the Director of Training at the commencement of training. 

### Order of training

CGT and AST can be completed:

* Sequentially in either order, providing that prerequisites for the AST have been met or
* concurrently, undertaking CGT and AST part-time.

If AST is undertaken at the beginning of training, a registrar must maintain currency in the discipline until the completion of training.

It is important to plan timing and sequencing of training, education and assessment activities. This training plan should be started at the beginning of training and reviewed regularly throughout training.

## Core Generalist Training

Core Generalist Training (CGT) may be started at PGY 2 or above. Training program requirements must be met in four areas: time, training, education and assessment.

### Time

CGT requires a minimum of three years full time equivalent (FTE) as described in the [Training Time policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-time-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=9e425ba0_8).

### Training

All training must take place in accredited training posts. Training placements must provide the opportunity to gain the required scope, type and volume of clinical experience, at an appropriate level of responsibility. 

ACRRM accredits training posts for CGT in regional, rural or remote areas of Australia. Accredited posts include general practices, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander medical services, hospitals, emergency departments and retrieval services. 

ACRRM accredited training posts are generally suited to doctors who can function competently, with significant responsibility for making patient care decisions, under broad supervision. 

ACRRM recognises training posts accredited by state or territory Postgraduate Medical Council (PMC) as training placements for CGT. These posts are suitable for doctors requiring higher levels of supervision for example doctors who commence training in PGY2.

ACRRM also recognises training posts accredited by other specialist colleges as suitable for short term placements up to three months to fulfil mandatory training requirements. Posts accredited by other specialist colleges may also be suitable for long term placements such as for an AST, however ACRRM accreditation is required. See [Training Placements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-placements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ff541e56_8).

#### Regional, rural and remote placements

Registrars are required to work in regional, rural and remote locations and gain experience across primary, secondary and emergency care in rural practice in order to gain the competencies, knowledge, skills and attributes described in the Core Generalist curriculum. All registrars must demonstrate minimum training requirements in these rural contexts. 

While training requirements for primary, hospital and emergency care and rural and remote practice are defined separately they are designed to be covered concurrently. The ideal training placement involves working in a rural general practice, admitting into the local hospital, providing inpatient care and after hours cover in the emergency department. Experience in rural primary, secondary and emergency contexts can also be gained through several training placements.

Example:

*You have worked for 12 months in a rural location in general practice at 0.5 FTE and at the local hospital at 0.5 FTE providing inpatient and emergency care.*

*As such you have now met your minimum training requirements of 12 months rural and remote training as well as six months primary care, three months emergency care and three months inpatient care.*

*You may then to build on your rural primary care and/or rural hospital experience and skills for the remainder of your CGT.*

#### Tertiary hospital placements

Doctors undertaking hospital placements in their junior doctor years (PGY1-3) must seek a combination of placements that provide generalist skills relevant to rural practice, including where possible the following placements: 

* General medicine
* General surgery
* Emergency
* Paediatrics
* Obstetrics and gynaecology; and
* Anaesthetics.

Other generalist placements that would be helpful to include are:

* Rehabilitation
* Aged care
* Palliative care
* Intensive care 
* Psychiatry
* Emergency (additional placement)

Experienced (PGY4+) doctors seeking to meet secondary care requirements must seek placements in rural hospitals where care is provided by generalists rather than large hospitals where care is provided primarily by specialists. 
For further information see [Training Placements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-placements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ff541e56_8).

#### *Training requirements*

The training requirements as described in the [Training Program Requirements policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/training-program-requirements-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=ae2186e7_8).

Registrars on AGPT and RVTS complete the program provided by their training organisation. IP and RGTS registrars follow the College education program, described below.

In 2023 AGPT, IP and RGTS registrars will all participate in the College education program. The 2023 program will include regional and national aspects. 

##### **College education program**

Participation in the College education program is mandatory requirement of Fellowship. The program includes four semesters (each consisting of five modules), two 5 day workshops, emergency courses and other support activities.  

##### **Semesters A & B**

Semesters A & B run for 1 semester each and are each composed of an online course and a 5-day face to face workshop. Semester A is facilitated during the first half of the year and Semester B during the second half of each year. They can be completed in any order depending on your training commencement date. 

**Online A**

Assessment eligibility requirements must be met prior to enrolling into an assessment see the [Assessment Eligibility policy](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/assessment-eligibility-policy.pdf?sfvrsn=bcf9fecc_14).

#### Assessment support

The College provides staged assessment support for IP and RGTS registrars, this is in addition to the mock exam and study groups offered to all registrars. 

Registrars that are unsuccessful in first assessment attempt complete a post assessment survey, a study plan and complete or repeat the applicable assessment online introduction course. A Medical Educator reviews the assessment results, survey response and provides advice on preparing for the next attempt. Additional Medical Educator sessions are provided for support and guidance with the next attempt.

Registrars that continue to be unsuccessful in the second attempt follow a similar program with the support of a Medical Educator with specialised skills in the specific assessment modality. Additional individual or group sessions are provided on understanding how the assessment is constructed and what the assessors are looking for plus practice of scenarios/cases. 

Where a registrar fails three or more times in a single, or multiple modalities, or where a registrar is seen as being at risk of not completing Fellowship, they are eligible to participate in the remediation program. Enrolment in the program is recommended by the Medical Educator and approved by the Director of Training.  

The registrar is referred to the remediation team and assigned a dedicated Medical Educator. Analysis and review are undertaken of training progress, assessment feedback survey and learning plan and further investigations/assessment undertaken to understand the reasons for poor performance. A preliminary remediation plan is drafted, reviewed, and approved by the Director of Training. The Remediation plan is discussed and finalised with registrar. Registrar must agree to participate actively in the program and sign an agreement, for remediation to commence.  

## Advanced Specialised Training

Advanced Specialised Training (AST) may be undertaken at any stage of training providing that registrars are at least postgraduate year three or above. It is expected that registrars have core generalist knowledge and skills in the discipline prior to commencing AST. 

### Training

AST may be undertaken as full time or part time training or in two or more blocks as appropriate to the discipline. Training must be undertaken in a training post accredited by ACRRM and be supervised by ACRRM accredited supervisors.

### Education

Registrars are expected to average a minimum of four hours per week engaged in educational activities related to the AST. A record of education must be kept by the registrar and discussed with the Supervisor and Medical Educator regularly throughout training. 

Registrars are expected to participate in the relevant Specialist College registrar education program where this is provided by the Training Post. The Specialist College education program should be supplemented with (or when a program is not provided, replaced with) education activities tailored to the AST curriculum. These education activities may come from a variety of sources. Courses that are provided or accredited by ACRRM are mapped to the Rural Generalist Curriculum to enable relevant courses to be identified. [Search under Online Learning](https://mycollege.acrrm.org.au/search?query=&clive=acrrm-event-public&collection=acrrm-meta-public) for the relevant curriculum Learning Area provided by ACRRM.

Registrars are encouraged to consider working towards related academic qualifications while undertaking their Advanced Specialised Training; especially when undertaking an AST in Population Health, Remote Medicine, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health, Academic Practice and Mental Health. This may include work towards Graduate Certificate, Graduate Diploma, or master’s level qualifications in a related area. See Appendix 3.

### Assessment

The following changes apply to registrars who commence an AST in 2021. Registrars who commenced an AST in 2020 or earlier are required to complete the requirements that applied when their AST commenced.

The supervisor report is replaced by a [Plan and Progress Report](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/plan-and-progress-report-advanced-specialised-training.docx?sfvrsn=d722b3cc_2) which begins with a training plan and is updated by the registrar and supervisor every three months. The report is submitted to the training organisation and ACRRM at [training@acrrm.org.au](mailto:training@acrrm.org.au) along with completed workplace based assessments and course certificates.

Registrars are strongly encouraged to complete and submit case based discussions conducted by a supervisor in addition to miniCEXs conducted by their supervisor. In the procedural ASTs some miniCEXs may be replaced by Direct Observation of Procedural Skills (DOPS). Formative workplace based assessments forms may be found [here](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/forms).

## Information, support and advocacy

While ACRRM training requirements are outlined in this handbook and the policies are the same nationally, there are differences regionally in the delivery of the program. There are also requirements that may be specific to your training pathway or Training Organisation. Therefore, you should contact your training organisation delivering your training first for specific advice. 

**College support**
The College delivers training directly on IP and RGTS. Registrars are allocated a Training Officer and a Medical Educator.
Training Officers are your point of contact throughout training, connecting you to the College and assisting you to navigate training requirements, policies, education and support programs. They will work with you, your Medical Educator and other stakeholders who are there to assist you in training.
Medical Educators are your coach and mentor in training. They provide clinical guidance and work with you to develop your training plan, as well as guiding your learning needs and assessment support.

ACRRM is also available to provide information about training and assessment. 

You may contact the College at any time by phone on 1800 223 226 or (07) 3105 8200 or email. If your query relates to:

* Training, your training officer will be your best contact. If emailing [training@acrrm.org.au](mailto:training@acrrm.org.au), your email will be directed to your training officer.
* Education, the Education Team will be your best contact, email [education@acrrm.org.au](mailto:education@acrrm.org.au)
* Assessment, the assessment team will be your best contact. Email: [assessment@acrrm.org.au](mailto:assessment@acrrm.org.au)
* Membership, ask for the Member Engagement Team when you call the College or email:  [membership@acrrm.org.au](mailto:membership@acrrm.org.au)

There is a range of available resources, communities and groups through the College and externally for you to connect and network, share your views and find support, including:

**Rural Medicine Australia conference**

ACRRM and Rural Doctors Association host the Rural Medicine Australia (RMA) annual conference and scientific forum each October.  The conference includes a wide range of presentations and workshops relevant to rural and remote practice. 

**Registrar Committee Assessment Guides**

The ACRRM Registrars' Committee [Assessment Guides](https://www.acrrm.org.au/resources/assessment/handbooks-guides) provide a quick reference, tips and tricks to all the ACRRM assessments. 

**Research Grants**

Registrars training on the AGPT pathway who wish to undertake research as part of training may apply for a funded [Academic Post](https://www.acrrm.org.au/support/grants/academic-posts). A registrar in an academic post will work 0.5 FTE in an academic institution and 0.5 FTE in a clinical position in an accredited training post. Registrars may choose to undertake Advanced Specialised Training in Academic Practice, Population Health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health or Remote Medicine. The topic of the research and the post where clinical work is undertaken will determine which AST is appropriate.

**ACRRM Registrar Committee**

The committee provides registrars of the College with an opportunity to provide feedback, suggestions, and advice to the ACRRM Board and Council, which ultimately determines College policy and direction. The Registrar Committee aims to have membership from all training pathways. The Committee represents the views of registrars in Committees of the College including the College Board, College Council, Education Council, Education and Training Committee and Assessment Committee. 

The Registrar Committee also represents and advocates for ACRRM registrars on a range of external national fora.

If you have any suggestions or feedback for the committee, or would like to join the committee, or get more involved – please email: [registrarchair@acrrm.org.au](mailto:registrarchair@acrrm.org.au).

**Registrars Online Community**

## Building respectful workplaces

ACRRM is committed to promoting and upholding safe and respectful workplaces and communities with a culture of belonging; where diversity is celebrated, and people can reach their full potential. 

Accordingly, the College framework to address issues of Bullying, Discrimination, Harassment and Racism is based on a resilience paradigm, emphasising proactive and preventive approaches to encourage positive behaviours across entire workplace cultures. 

While regulatory processes are in place our focus is on creating training and work environments for our members which understand and value respectful behaviours and which enable the individuals within them to learn, improve, and support their peers towards creating a better workplace

An overview of the College framework for preventing and addressing bullying, discrimination, racism and harassment is provided [here](https://www.acrrm.org.au/docs/default-source/all-files/respectful-workplaces.pdf?sfvrsn=5f7e58c0_2).

## Comments, compliments and complaints

ACRRM welcomes all feedback from registrars and others to enable continued improvement of training. Any formal complaints received by the College will be managed appropriately and will also be de-identified and considered for the purposes of ongoing program improvement. Feedback is encouraged anytime:

* by phoning 1800 223 226 or emailing our training team [training@acrrm.org.au](mailto:training@acrrm.org.au); or 
* by emailing the Registrar committee [registrarchair@acrrm.org.au](mailto:registrarchair@acrrm.org.au)

ACRRM invites registrars to provide feedback via online surveys:

* following education or assessment events
* training program feedback surveys, and
* as required around specific areas. 

#### Resolving problems

If you have a problem or concern during training the following general principles should assist you to resolve the concern. 

* Direct contact is usually the quickest and most effective way to resolve an issue. Raise the issue with the person involved and explain your point of view. Under normal circumstances, this discussion should occur as close to the time of the relevant event as possible. 
* If you feel that the issue was not dealt with appropriately as a result of speaking with the person most directly involved, or if you feel uncomfortable speaking with the direct contact, then you should speak with the next senior person of responsibility. 
* If you still feel that the issue has not been resolved satisfactorily, you should speak with someone in a senior management position in the organisation responsible. 
* If you feel that the issue has not been resolved satisfactorily, lodge a formal complaint in writing.

There are many organisations involved in general practice training and it may not always be clear where to direct your concern. You may wish to seek guidance on where to direct your concern from your training organisation or from ACRRM. As a general guide, the areas of responsibility for the College include the following:

* on all ACRRM training pathways – delivery of assessment 
* on the Independent Pathway - delivery of education and support
* on the AGPT and RVTS pathways – ensuring training organisations uphold the College Standards for Supervisors and Teaching Posts and Standards for Training Organisations and deliver training in accordance with the ACRRM curriculum.

Areas in which the College does not have direct responsibility include, on AGPT and RVTS:

* the delivery of education
* placement of registrars
* identifying, supporting and monitoring supervisors and teaching posts.

ACRRM, AGPT and all the training organisations will have a complaints policy to guide the process. 

Where all efforts to resolve the Complaint at the local level have been exhausted, the registrars can refer the matter to the College for consideration.
